The politic condition in Indonesia due to the impact of Trump stupidity in running US

In recent years, the United States has been facing various challenges, including its relations with several countries, particularly those in Asia. One such challenge is the political situation in Indonesia, which has been affected by the presidency of Donald Trump.

Trump's unpredictability and nationalist rhetoric have led to a significant shift in US foreign policy, causing tensions with many countries, including Indonesia.

Indonesia, being a key player in Southeast Asian politics, has taken notice of these developments. The country's government has expressed concerns about the impact of Trump's policies on regional stability and security.

One notable example is the US decision to impose sanctions on several Indonesian companies for their alleged involvement in the 2018-2019 Papua conflict.

This move was widely criticized by Indonesia, which argued that it was a form of protectionism and would harm its economy. The sanctions were eventually lifted after international pressure was applied.

Despite these challenges, Indonesia has been working to strengthen its ties with the US, particularly in areas such as trade and security cooperation.

For instance, the two countries have signed several agreements on maritime boundaries and fisheries management, which aim to promote regional stability and economic growth.

However, the relationship remains complex, and there are still many issues that need to be addressed. The Indonesian government has expressed concerns about US support for certain groups in the region, including the Free Papua Movement (OPM).

The OPM is a separatist group that seeks independence for West Papua, which is claimed by Indonesia but controlled by the Papuan people.

Indonesia's government argues that the OPM is a terrorist organization and has been responsible for numerous attacks on civilians and security forces.

Despite these concerns, there have been efforts to improve relations between the two countries. For example, in 2020, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Indonesia and met with President Jokowi to discuss regional issues and cooperation.

However, tensions remain, and the Indonesian government has expressed concerns about US support for certain groups in the region.

In conclusion, the politic condition in Indonesia due to the impact of Trump stupidity in running US is complex and multifaceted. While there have been efforts to improve relations between the two countries, many challenges remain, including issues related to regional stability and security.

As a result, Indonesia will continue to monitor developments in the region closely and explore ways to strengthen its ties with the US while addressing its concerns about US support for certain groups.
