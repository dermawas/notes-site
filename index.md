> Notes on systems, tools, and the process of figuring things out (mostly for myself).

Welcome — this is my working log: part notes, part diagrams, part reflection.  
I document what I learn while building, fixing, and understanding systems — digital, mechanical, and human.  
Not about perfection; about curiosity, iteration, and making sense of what we build.
