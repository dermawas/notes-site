### Project: Selling 22 Hectares of Land in West Java

I started trying to sell this land back in **2012**.  
Thirteen years later, it still hasn’t sold.

But what began as a frustrating process slowly turned into a long learning journey — revealing how land transactions in Indonesia really work, how trust is tested, and how caution can save you from trouble.

This post summarizes what I’ve learned so far.

## 1. Many “Buyers” Are Not Buyers

Over the years, I’ve met all kinds of people:

- **Fake buyers** — intermediaries who act like they want to buy, negotiate hard, ask for commitment letters, and then disappear.  
- **Casual agents** — people who just ask questions; that’s fine, part of selling.  
- **Local groups** — even community representatives claiming to have buyers, asking for handwritten notes about price and commitment, but without any real buyer behind them.

These experiences taught me that verification matters more than enthusiasm.

## 2. Guard Your Documents

Never give out copies of your land certificates — especially the originals.  
If someone insists on seeing them, only provide a **PDF with a large watermark** that says *“COPY”* or *“For Verification Only”*.

Never sign anything unnecessary.  
A scanned or photographed signature can be reused elsewhere — even on a fraudulent **Akta Jual Beli (AJB)**.

## 3. Verify Who You’re Talking To

When someone claims to be a buyer, don’t rush to trust. Ask:

- “Will you be the one signing the AJB?”  
- “Will the payment come directly from your account?”

If they hesitate, they’re probably an agent.  
If they say they have a buyer, insist on meeting that buyer directly.  

You can say:  
> “I’ll give my best price — but once agreed, the buyer shouldn’t renegotiate.”

That’s usually where intermediaries stop calling.

When you finally meet the **real buyer**, take time to confirm:
- The **agreed purchase price**  
- The **payment method and schedule**  
- The **responsibilities for transaction costs** such as the notary (PPAT) fee, tax, and certificate verification  

Documenting these terms clearly before signing anything prevents misunderstanding later and keeps the transaction transparent for both sides.

## 4. Beware of Mark-Up Deals

A common trick:  
> “If the buyer transfers a higher amount, we’ll send the extra back to you.”

This means they plan to **mark up your price** and take the difference.  
That’s not negotiation — that’s manipulation.

A fair agent fee is **1%–2.5%**, not a hidden margin.

---

## 5. Match Your Transaction Price with the AJB

This part is critical.

By law, sellers pay a **2.5% final income tax (PPh Final)** based on the official sale price.  
Trouble begins when the AJB lists a lower price than the real transaction.

### Example:

| Area | Transaction Price | AJB Price | Total | Final Tax (2.5%) |
|------|-------------------|-----------|--------|------------------|
| 10,000 m² | Rp 350,000/m² | Rp 275,000/m² | Rp 3.5B vs Rp 2.75B | Rp 87.5M vs Rp 68.75M |

If you report taxes using the AJB price, two problems appear:

- **Tax discrepancy:** You’ll owe additional tax since your reported income doesn’t match your actual sale.  
- **Bank compliance:** Banks automatically report large transfers to the **OJK**.  
  If your account receives Rp 3.5B but your AJB says Rp 2.75B, it will trigger an audit — and explaining that gap isn’t fun.

Always make sure **transaction price = AJB price**.  
Never agree to “under-the-table” adjustments. It’s not worth the risk.

---

## 6. Choose a Verified PPAT Notary

Not every notary can handle land sales.  
Only **PPAT Notaries** registered with **ATR/BPN** are authorized for property transfers.

Always check:
- The notary’s name and photo on the official ATR/BPN website.  
- That you meet the PPAT in person — not just their assistant.

It’s your right to transact directly with the authorized professional.

## Final Reflection

Selling land isn’t just about finding a buyer.  
It’s about managing risk — legal, financial, and personal.  

Always meet the buyer face-to-face, clarify the terms, and ensure everything is written and acknowledged properly.  
Patience and process will protect you more than any shortcut.

After more than a decade, I’ve learned that being cautious doesn’t slow you down — it protects your future.

If this story helps even one other landowner avoid mistakes I made, then the wait has been worthwhile.
