### Project: Selling 22 Hectares of Land in West Java

I started trying to sell this land back in **2012**.  
Thirteen years later, it still hasn’t sold.

But what began as a frustrating process slowly turned into a long learning journey — revealing how land transactions in Indonesia really work, how trust is tested, and how caution can save you from trouble.

This post summarizes what I’ve learned so far.

## 1. Many “Buyers” Are Not Buyers

Over the years, I’ve met all kinds of people:

- **Fake buyers** — intermediaries who act like they want to buy, negotiate hard, ask for commitment letters, and then disappear.  
- **Casual agents** — people who just ask questions; that’s fine, part of selling.  
- **Local groups** — even community representatives claiming to have buyers, asking for handwritten notes about price and commitment, but without any real buyer behind them.

These experiences taught me that verification matters more than enthusiasm.

## 2. Guard Your Documents

Never give out copies of your land certificates — especially the originals.  
If someone insists on seeing them, only provide a **PDF with a large watermark** that says *“COPY”* or *“For Verification Only”*.

Never sign anything unnecessary.  
A scanned or photographed signature can be reused elsewhere — even on a fraudulent **Akta Jual Beli (AJB)**.

## 3. Verify Who You’re Talking To

When someone claims to be a buyer, don’t rush to trust. Ask:

- “Will you be the one signing the AJB?”  
- “Will the payment come directly from your account?”

If they hesitate, they’re probably an agent.  
If they say they have a buyer, insist on meeting that buyer directly.  

You can say:
