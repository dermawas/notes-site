# Fiction: *The Echo of Reason*  
*A Short Introduction to the World*

The day she turned seventeen, **Lira** received her first Directive.

Her Companion Unit—a silver sphere the size of an apple—hovered beside her, humming softly with alien stability. It projected a blue sigil in the air:

> **“You have reached the age of Contribution.”**

Most teenagers dreaded this moment.  
Lira felt only clarity.

Around her, the city gleamed like logic made real: glass towers, floating gardens, and the hum of unlimited alien energy. Children passed through clean streets, each followed by their quiet Companion Units like watchful fireflies.

No hunger.  
No corruption.  
No inherited privilege.  
No crimes unsolved.  
No accident of birth.

The **United Rational Collective** was not perfect—perfection was an illusion—but it was fair.

Her Directive contained her first assignment:

> **“Compose a theory, artwork, invention, or argument that benefits humanity.  
Your work will be added to the Ledger of Contribution.”**

Lira touched her forehead.  
She always felt too much—more than others who spoke in clean, rational lines.  
Her emotions swirled like storms inside her.

So she painted.

A week later, her mural stretched across the Learning Hall:  
a surreal landscape where raw emotions—fear, grief, love—unfolded into geometric clarity, transforming chaos into understanding.

Citizens gathered, voting not with cheers but with analyses:

- “This clarifies emotional structure.”  
- “Useful for children learning self-regulation.”  
- “Provides insight into pre-rational states.”  

Lira’s heart trembled.  
Her chaos had become contribution.

One morning, her CU spoke softly:

> **“Your Contribution Threshold approaches reproduction eligibility.”**

She laughed.  
She wasn’t planning children yet—not until she had shaped her future.

But she felt proud.  
Proud in a way the old world would have denied her for being too emotional, too artistic, too intense.

The old world—  
where fools led nations,  
where children were born into misery,  
where abusers hid behind walls,  
where corruption devoured hope.

Here—  
every voice mattered.  
Every mistake was recorded but only opened when needed.  
Every idea lived forever in the Hall of Records.

And every emotion—  
no matter how wild—  
could become something rational  
if shaped with intention.
