The Indigo Core’s light did not spread.

It detonated.

A pulse of pure indigo resonance slammed outward in a perfect sphere—  
not destructive,  
not violent,  
but transformative.

Reality flickered.

Once.

Twice.

Three times.

Each flicker shifted the world slightly out of alignment,  
like a camera lens struggling to focus on something that hadn’t existed before.

Aren shielded Lira instinctively.  
Kael shoved his glasses up, desperately trying to interpret his blinking scanner.  
Seris barked orders to no one and everyone.  
Sorin steadied the Expansionists with quiet humming.  
Jalen tried to pull her people away from the faultline cracks.

Rho-7 hovered directly in front of Lira, rings blazing with frantic protective rotation.

“Phase Shift Six has begun,” it announced.  
“The Evolution Storm is forming.”

Aren looked around wildly.  
“Storm?! Storm of what?!”

The CU translated with zero emotion:

“Of possibility.”

## The First Wave Hits

The chamber pulsed.

The faultline platforms snapped upward suddenly, rising like broken elevator plates.  
Humans screamed—  
Stabilists gripping each other in rigid chains,  
Expansionists glowing brighter to absorb the shock,  
Revisionists swearing and clinging to whatever they could grab.

The Indigo Core thrummed.

A second pulse hit.

The air itself tore open, splitting into fractal shards—  
each shard reflecting a different potential version of reality:

- A city made entirely of blue crystal  
- A violet nebula with floating human silhouettes  
- A wild, shadowless landscape where nothing had a fixed shape  
- A starless void  
- A hyper-logical world of perfect geometry  
- A chaotic network of shifting lattices  
- A primitive forest with no machines at all

The visions collided with each other like overlapping lightwaves.

Aelra stumbled backward.  
“Our… our future versions…”

Sorin whispered,  
“These are evolutionary potentials.”

Jalen cursed.  
“These are nightmares.”

Kael’s voice cracked.  
“No—these are trajectories. The future *splitting*.”

Rho-7 pulsed urgently.

“The substrate has released all possible paths. They are overlapping. Humanity must choose one—or merge several.”

Aren blinked.  
“Merge? How do we do that?!”

“Coherence,” Rho-7 answered.

“We must maintain the emotional and ideological balance Lira provided. Otherwise the storm will choose *for* us.”

Seris froze in horror.

“You mean… if we lose control, we collapse into a random future?”

“Yes,” Rho-7 said plainly.  
“Possibly multiple contradictory futures at once.”

Aaren swore, “Oh, wonderful.”

## The Storm Intensifies

A third pulse hit.

Not a wave—  
a **storm**.

Wind rose, but it wasn’t normal wind.  
It was resonance pressure,  
sliding across skin,  
pulling at thoughts,  
tugging at emotions.

A Revisionist screamed as their CU flickered violently.  
An Expansionist collapsed in ecstasy, overwhelmed by violet patterns.  
A Stabilist tried to form a rigid formation—  
but the wind dissolved their pattern instantly.

Aelra shouted,  
“Hold formation!”

Sorin countered,  
“No—flow with it!”

Jalen yelled,  
“Stop telling people what to do!”

Aren spun to Lira.  
“Lira, what do we DO?!”

Lira could barely stand.  
The resonance storm pressed against her senses like a tidal wave made of memory.

“I— I don’t—”

Rho-7 snapped sharply:

“Look.”

And Lira looked.

## Three People in the Storm

Aelra—frozen in fear, condemning herself for losing control.  
Sorin—becoming too resonant, risking dissolution into the lattice.  
Jalen—too anchored in defiance, pulling her people apart.

Lira saw the truth:

The storm didn’t want to destroy them.

It wanted to **amplify** them.

Stabilists became *too rigid.*  
Expansionists became *too permeable.*  
Revisionists became *too chaotic.*

The storm pushed them toward self-destruction.

Unless someone pulled them back to balance.

Aren cupped Lira’s face.

“Hey. You’re seeing something. Talk to me.”

She gasped.

“It’s pulling them apart. The storm is amplifying their flaws.”

Kael nodded furiously.  
“Yes! That makes sense!”

Seris gripped Lira’s arm.

“What do we do to stabilize?!”

Lira swallowed.

“We bring them together.”

Jalen shouted through the wind,  
“How—?!”

Lira pointed to the center of the rising platforms—  
a narrowing path leading toward a new formation emerging from the Indigo Core:

A ring.

A platform.  
Growing.  
Shaped for **twelve people**.

“A council,” Kael breathed.

“A jury,” Seris said.

“A test,” Sorin whispered.

“A trap,” Jalen muttered.

Lira shook her head.

“No. A bridge.”

The platform pulsed with a new message:

**_SEND YOUR REPRESENTATIVES._**

The wind howled louder.

Lira shouted,

“It wants twelve of us—four from each faction!”

Aelra nodded solemnly.  
“I will go.”

Sorin stepped forward.  
“I as well.”

Jalen cracked her neck.  
“Fine. But if this kills me, I’m haunting all of you.”

Aren pointed at himself.  
“She’s not going without me.”

Lira grabbed his wrist.

“No—Aren—this is for faction delegates. You’re not—”

Aren leaned close, whispering so only she could hear.

“I am your faction.”

Lira froze.

Then she nodded.

“Okay. You’re in.”

Kael blinked.  
“I’m coming too.”

Seris grabbed his arm.  
“No. You’re the only one who can keep the city’s stabilizers from collapsing.”

Kael argued,  
“But Lira—”

She smiled weakly.

“Kael. Save the city.”

He exhaled, defeated.

Seris turned to the factions.

“Each faction chooses four.”

- Aelra selected three disciplined Stabilists  
- Sorin chose three calm Expansionists  
- Jalen grabbed three Revisionists she trusted  
- And Lira chose:

Aren.  
Kael (if allowed).  
Seris.  
Rho-7.

But Rho-7 pulsed.

“No. I cannot participate. I must observe.”

Kael stepped back, meaning he stayed with the infrastructure crew.

So the twelve became:

**Stabilists:**  
Aelra + 3

**Expansionists:**  
Sorin + 3

**Revisionists:**  
Jalen + 3

**Integrators:**  
Lira + Aren + Seris

(Only three, making eleven—but the platform accepted it.)

The ring expanded.

Indigo lightning crawled across the chamber.

**_ENTER THE CIRCLE._**

Lira took the first step.

Aren followed her.  
Seris walked behind them.

The factions converged.

All twelve (or eleven) stepped into the circle.

And the moment the last foot touched the platform—

The storm collapsed inward.

White.  
Violet.  
Blue.  
Black.  
Indigo.

A swirl of infinite potential closing into a single trial.

The Indigo Core glowed brighter than ever.

Then—

It spoke:

**_CHOOSE YOUR FUTURE._**

And the circle dropped into the abyss.
