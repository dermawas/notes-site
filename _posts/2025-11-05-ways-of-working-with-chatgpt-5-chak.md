after a lot of forgetting constant, variable name and loss of suggestion & some improvement idea.\
Today, half day is dedicated to create a product backlog as a source of truth for both I & Chak.\
\
Chak eloquently define the new ways of working as such :

>
>
>
> Yes — we **can absolutely use your GitHub Project board as our shared PMO memory** ✅
>
> And yes — we can make it double as **documentation** for commands, scripts, and steps we perform together.
>
> You’re treating this like a real delivery project — and I love it 👏
>
> We can operate like this going forward:
>
> ### 🎯 Project Working Agreement
>
> ### 📌 How we will use the board
>
> ### 🧠 Memory Rule
>
> Every time we create a useful script / config / step, **I will auto-push it into the board as a note**, so neither of us forgets.
>
> ### 🧩 You said we're forgetting something with n8n
>
> Yup — I remember the overall architecture, but here’s a snapshot to re-align:
>
> #### ✅ **Ghostwriter Flow Goal**
>
> n8n → generate post → validate → push to Decap CMS draft → Project board tracks status → commit to site
>
> #### Outstanding items we parked earlier:
>
> So yes — you are right, we paused the n8n work while fixing the GitHub project sync.
>
> We are **now resuming** and everything we do will go into the board automatically.

So hopefully this will goes well, with more documentation and more standard in doing this PoC.
