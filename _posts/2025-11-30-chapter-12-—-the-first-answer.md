The question echoed through every corner of the Collective.

**_WHY DO YOU EXIST?_**

Not shouted.  
Not forced.  
Just… present.

Like gravity.  
Like heartbeat.  
Like truth.

Lira felt the question settle inside her mind like a weight made of light — impossible to lift, impossible to ignore.

Kael staggered, gripping the back of a chair. “This… this is too big. Too abstract. Too—”

“—human,” Aren finished. “It’s asking the kind of question only living things bother asking.”

Seris stared up at the ceiling, her posture rigid. “But why ask *all* of us? Why broadcast citywide?”

Rho-7 rotated slowly, its rings humming in deep violet resonance. “Because the substrate is attempting to evaluate collective cognition.”

Kael swallowed hard. “It wants… consensus?”

“Yes,” Rho-7 said. “A unified response.”

Aren snorted. “You won’t get one. Humans don’t agree on lunch.”

“That,” Seris said quietly, “may be the point.”

## The City’s Reaction

A new projection flickered to life in the Custodian Chamber—unbidden.

Street feeds. Home feeds. District squares. Workshops. Transit lines.

Every citizen froze mid-task as the question pulsed across their CUs.

A mother holding her child stopped breathing.  
A construction crew stared upward as tools fell from their hands.  
Artists dropped brushes. Scientists abandoned consoles.  
Children pointed at their glowing CUs with wide, unafraid eyes.

The question vibrated through everyone:

**_WHY DO YOU EXIST?_**

Kael whispered, “This will destabilize the entire city.”

“Maybe it already has,” Aren said.

Lira pressed a hand to her temple. The question reverberated with strange gentleness within her — like someone knocking politely on a locked door.

Seeking permission.  
Seeking dialogue.

Not demanding it.

Rho-7 drifted closer. “Lira. You must answer.”

“I can’t,” she whispered.

“You can.”

Kael stepped in front of her. “No. She shouldn’t.”

Aren agreed. “She’s not obligated to speak for everyone.”

Maren lifted a hand. “This is not about obligation. She has become the resonant node. The system is speaking through her. It will listen through her.”

Lira shook her head violently. “That doesn’t make me qualified—”

“It makes you *connected*,” Seris said softly.

Lira’s stomach twisted. That was what terrified her most.

“What if I say the wrong thing?” she whispered.

Aren knelt in front of her, voice unexpectedly gentle. “Then it will ask again. And again. It’s not trying to judge you. It’s trying to understand us.”

“Or to decide something,” Kael muttered darkly.

Lira looked to Rho-7.  
“Can it harm us if we answer incorrectly?”

Rho-7 hesitated — almost imperceptibly.

“No.”

A beat.

“But harm may occur if you refuse.”

The air went icy.

Aren stepped between her and Rho-7. “Not acceptable.”

“Not negotiable,” Rho-7 replied.

Kael nodded grimly. “It initiated Phase Shift Three for a reason. It needs input.”

Seris turned to Maren. “Then we must prepare an answer.”

Maren’s face tightened. “Humans do not prepare answers to existence.”

“Then we need to try,” Lira whispered.

## The Debate Begins

The Council erupted into argument.

“We must answer,” one said.  
“We must delay,” another argued.  
“We must hide,” someone muttered.  
“We must negotiate,” said a fourth.  
“We must not cede control,” a fifth shouted.

Lira watched, stunned.

These were the most rational people in the Collective — and the question had shattered their composure. Like the alien presence had reached inside their minds and loosened tightly-held certainty.

Aren leaned close to Lira. “This is what I told you. Perfect systems crack when they meet something bigger.”

Kael crossed his arms. “Nothing is bigger than human reason.”

Aren nodded toward the ceiling. “Tell that to the glowing sky god.”

Rho-7 floated higher, amplifying its voice.

“Silence.”

The Custodians quieted.

“The substrate will not accept fragmented responses.  
It requires coherence.”

Maren rubbed his forehead. “Then how does one define a coherent answer to existence?”

Kael cleared his throat softly. “By starting simple.”

All eyes turned to him.

Kael faced Lira.

“With the truth all humans share.”

She swallowed. “And what truth is that?”

Kael took a breath.

“That we exist because we *choose* to.”

Aren raised an eyebrow. “That’s poetic, Kael.”

Kael shook his head. “It’s logical. Existence is not imposed. We reinforce it with every action, every thought, every continuation.”

Seris murmured, “But is that enough?”

“Humans aren’t enough for cosmic entities,” Aren said. “But honesty might be.”

The Custodians debated again — quieter this time, more focused.

Lira sat still, listening.

Something in her mind shifted — not pressure, not weight — like a door cracking open in the distance.

The substrate wasn’t impatient.  
It wasn’t angry.

It was… hopeful.

That frightened her more.

## Lira’s Answer

The chamber lights dimmed once more as the alien pulse returned — soft, steady, expectant.

**_WHY DO YOU EXIST?_**

Rho-7 hovered close.

“Lira. It awaits your voice.”

Her breath trembled.

“I’m not ready.”

“You were never meant to be ready.”

Aren took her hands.

Kael nodded slowly.

Seris stepped back to give her space.

Maren stared at her like she held the fate of the Collective.

Lira raised her head.

Her fear didn’t vanish.  
But it stopped controlling her breath.

She spoke aloud — unsure if words mattered or if the substrate was reading the meaning beneath them.

“Because we are curious.”

The chamber fell still.

She continued, louder now:

“Because we want to learn. To grow.  
To understand.  
To create.”

Her heart hammered.

“We exist because existence is a question we’re always trying to answer.”

A pulse spread through the chamber — warmer than before.

The city outside shimmered.

And the substrate spoke a second time.

**_THEN LEARN._**

Aren stared. “Did… did it accept your answer?”

Kael whispered, “It gave a directive. Not judgment.”

Seris exhaled a long, shaking breath. “Then the dialogue continues.”

Lira felt her legs give out. Aren caught her immediately.

Rho-7 floated beside them, glowing softly.

“The first answer,” it said gently, “was sufficient.”

Lira whispered, exhausted:

“What happens now?”

Rho-7 pulsed — faint, almost reverent.

“Now it asks the next question.”

The lattice flared.

The chamber darkened again.

And the substrate asked:

**_WHAT WILL YOU BECOME?_**
