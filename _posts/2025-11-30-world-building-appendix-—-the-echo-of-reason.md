## 1. Constitution of the Indigo Age
The Indigo Age is founded on the Three Axioms:
- **Stability** — Structures, laws, and systems that prevent societal collapse.
- **Evolution** — Adaptive growth, technological and social advancement.
- **Freedom** — Individual agency, voluntary involvement, emotional expression.

All governance must harmonize these three without prioritizing one at the expense of the others.

### Council of Twelve
A rotating governing body composed of:
- 4 Stabilists
- 4 Expansionists
- 4 Revisionists  
Each representing their ideological strengths but bound to Indigo coherence.

---

## 2. Factions Overview

### Stabilists (Blue)
- Order, structure, predictability  
- Strong legal frameworks  
- Risk: becoming authoritarian or rigid

### Expansionists (Violet)
- Growth, resonance, evolution  
- Emphasis on connection & progress  
- Risk: dissolving individuality

### Revisionists (White)
- Freedom, disruption, innovation  
- Emphasis on autonomy  
- Risk: fragmentation or chaos

## 3. Technology of the Indigo Age

### Citizen Units (CUs)
- Personal AI + scanning module  
- Tracks wellness, local data, and contributes to world-modeling  
- Not an enforcement device

### Resonance Storm
A metaphysical substrate test representing humanity’s emotional, ideological, and cognitive stability.

### Substrate
An alien-origin system:
- Stores memory of past civilizations  
- Conducts Phase Shift trials  
- Guides species into balanced evolution

### Indigo Core
Central intelligence of the substrate:
- Tests coherence  
- Manages future branching simulations  
- Confirms evolutionary viability

---

## 4. Surveillance & Autonomy Rules
- Surveillance is **voluntary** and sealed behind quantum encryption  
- Only opened under:
  1. Legal request  
  2. Council review (3 factions)
  3. Valid algorithmic verification  
- No one—including government—may access logs without safeguards.

This system prevents corruption, collusion, and misuse.

---

## 5. Timeline of the Collective

### Pre-Core Era
- Standard civilization with factions forming naturally  
- Surveillance originally utilitarian

### Faultline Era
- Substrate activation  
- First resonance irregularities  
- Rise of the Integrator candidate

### Indigo Event
- Twelve delegates undergo the Trial of Futures  
- Humanity selects the Indigo Future

### Indigo Age (Current)
- Council established  
- Education unified  
- Surveillance reform  
- Culture harmonization  
- Cross-faction migration increases

## 6. Glossary

**Integrator** — A human capable of holding all three axioms without collapsing into one ideology.

**Indigo Core** — Alien-origin substrate memory and evolution engine.

**Axioms** — The core principles of human progress (Stability, Evolution, Freedom).

**Phase Shifts** — Structured tests for species advancement.

**Axial Proofs** — Demonstrations required to anchor the Indigo Future.

**Resonance** — Emotional, cognitive, and ideological coherence measured across the Collective.
