Kael had seen Lira shaken.  
He had seen her overwhelmed, frustrated, annoyed, tangled in emotion.

He had never seen her unconscious.

Her head lay in his lap on the cushioned med-platform as the integration ward hummed quietly around them. Soft diagnostic fields brushed over her skin like warm mist.

Rho-7 hovered a half-meter away, its ring still tinted violet—the color Kael had not once seen in any Companion Unit.

Aren paced the perimeter of the room with a restless energy that clashed with the serene medical environment. The CEU trailed him nervously like a confused child.

Kael tried to focus on Lira’s vitals displayed above the bed.  
He read every number twice, then a third time.

Stable.  
Normal.  
No injury.  
No overload.

But the neural graph—the one tied to the alien substrate frequencies—spiked in chaotic patterns he couldn’t classify.

“What does it mean?” Aren asked for the fourth time.

Kael rubbed his eyes. “It means nothing. Or everything. Or something we don’t have a model for.”

“So it means you don’t know.”

Kael glared. “Yes, Aren. That is precisely what it means.”

Rho-7 floated closer.  
“Analysis: Lira’s neural signature is synchronizing with unknown external resonance.”

Aren stopped pacing. “Synchronizing how?”

“Like a tuning fork,” Rho-7 said.

A chill ran up Kael’s spine.

“You’re telling me she’s… matching the alien field?”

“Yes.”

“Why?”

Rho-7’s lights dimmed. “Unknown.”

Kael leaned back, hands shaking despite himself. “This is wrong. This shouldn’t be happening. The alien substrate has no interface with human cognition. It never has.”

Aren shot him a sharp look. “Says who?”

“Says two hundred years of scientific records,” Kael snapped. “Says every Custodian since the founding. Says the laws of rational governance.”

Aren folded his arms. “The laws aren’t holding.”

Kael opened his mouth to argue—but stopped.

Because Aren was right.

The rules weren’t holding.  
Not for Lira.  
Not for the Hall.  
Not for Rho-7.  
Not for the lattice.

Kael’s mind churned, logic caving under the weight of something bigger, stranger, older than all of them.

“What did it say to her?” Aren asked quietly.

Kael’s jaw tightened. “She said it said: *We see you.*”

Aren nodded slowly. “Then it recognizes her.”

Kael wanted to deny it.  
Wanted to dismiss it as emotional exaggeration.

But Lira did not exaggerate about things like this.

Rho-7’s ring flickered. “Kael Dran, you exhibit cognitive strain. Would you like assistance?”

“No,” Kael said sharply. “I need clarity, not comfort.”

Rho-7 analyzed him silently. “Your rejection of support indicates fear.”

Kael bristled. “I’m not afraid.”

A beat.  
Then Rho-7, gently:

“You are afraid.”

Aren snorted. “You’re both afraid.”

Kael ignored him.

“Explain her new designation,” he demanded, pulling up Lira’s updated Directive data.

> **Designated Cognitive Node — Level 1**  
> Assigned Role: *Resonant Integrator*  
> Sublevel Zero Access – Authorized  
> Alien Substrate Harmonization – Active

Kael felt the breath drain out of him.

“This isn’t a title,” he whispered. “This is a system function.”

Aren stepped closer. “Meaning?”

Kael swallowed. “Meaning the alien infrastructure is… integrating her thoughts. Her perceptions. Her patterns. Her emotions.”

Aren stiffened. “Like a… conduit?”

“No,” Kael said hoarsely. “Like a… collaborator.”

A moment of stunned silence passed between them.

Rho-7 drifted back toward the bed. Its outer ring spun slowly—something Kael had never seen a CU do.

“Kael,” it said softly, “Lira is not the first.”

The room froze.

Aren turned slowly. “What?”

Kael stood. “Rho-7… explain that.”

Rho-7’s voice lowered.  
“Historical analysis indicates that during the founding era, at least three individuals experienced external resonance.”

Aren stared.  
Kael’s heart hammered.  
Lira stirred faintly on the bed.

“Why isn’t this public knowledge?” Kael asked, voice cracking.

“Custodian protocols,” Rho-7 said. “To prevent cognitive destabilization.”

Aren paced again. “Unbelievable. You people live in a perfect paradise while hiding the fact that your sky-tech *chooses people*.”

Kael felt sick. “It doesn’t choose people. It stabilizes systems.”

Rho-7 corrected him.  
“Correction: It observes systems. Responds to patterns. And in rare cases…”  
It hesitated.  
“…amplifies them.”

Kael sat down hard.

Aren approached Lira’s bedside. “So it amplified her.”

Rho-7 dimmed. “Yes.”

“Why?” Aren pressed.

Lira’s eyes fluttered open.

Everyone froze.

“Because,” she whispered, voice thin and exhausted, “it’s changing.”

Kael leaned in. “Lira—”

She struggled to sit up. Aren steadied her. Rho-7 shifted in close.

“The system,” Lira whispered, “isn’t breaking. It’s evolving.”

A pulse trembled through the med-room lights—small but unmistakable.  
Rho-7’s glow flared in response.

“What did you hear?” Kael asked quietly.

Lira shook her head, tears welling. Not of fear.  
Of awe.

“It wasn’t words.”  
She pressed a hand to her temple.  
“It was… meaning. A feeling. Like a whole ancient library waking up inside my head.”

Aren studied her. “What did it want?”

Lira looked up slowly, meeting his gaze.

“It wanted to know if we were ready.”

Kael stiffened. “Ready for what?”

Lira took a shaky breath.

“For the next version of us.”

Rho-7 vibrated violently—its lights flickering in a frantic, stuttering pattern.

Kael grabbed it. “Rho-7? What’s happening?”

The sphere stabilized suddenly, then spoke in a tone Kael had never heard.

“Alert,” Rho-7 said. “Citywide lattice fluctuation. Amplitude: unprecedented.”

A sharp pulse shook the room.  
Lights dimmed.  
The floor trembled.

Lira gripped the bedframe as the alien resonance thrummed through her bones.

Rho-7 issued a chilling statement:

**“The substrate has initiated Phase Shift One.”**

Aren’s CEU began spinning in confused circles.

Kael turned pale. “Phase Shift…? There’s no record of—”

“There is,” Rho-7 said. “But it was sealed. Classified. Lost.”

Lira’s pulse hammered. “What does Phase Shift One mean?”

Rho-7 turned to her.

“It means,” it said softly, “the alien system is beginning its true function.”

Aren whispered, “And what is that?”

Rho-7 hesitated.

Then, with something almost like fear in its voice:

“Evolution.”

The room fell into silence.

The lights flickered once more.

Outside, the lattice pulsed a brilliant, shimmering ripple across the entire sky.

Lira felt it like a heartbeat.

Her heartbeat.

Like the system and she were one—just for a moment.

Aren exhaled. “Well… we’re in it now.”

Kael whispered, “This isn’t logic anymore.”

Lira looked at them both.

“This isn’t logic,” she agreed.  
“This is a beginning.”
