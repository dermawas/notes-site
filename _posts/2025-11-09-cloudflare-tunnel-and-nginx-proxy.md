The Indonesian economy has long been heavily reliant on exports, particularly in the manufacturing sector. However, this reliance creates vulnerabilities to global economic fluctuations, as seen during the 2008 financial crisis and more recently during the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of these events was exacerbated by the US-China trade war, which led to a decline in global demand for Indonesian goods.

As a result, Indonesia's economy has struggled to recover, with GDP growth rates averaging around 4% per annum between 2010 and 2020. This slow growth is largely due to the country's dependence on exports, particularly in the energy sector, which accounts for over 20% of total exports.

The impact of global economic downturns on Indonesia has been further exacerbated by its reliance on foreign investment, particularly from China. The country's foreign exchange reserves have been declining steadily since 2015, largely due to the decline in commodity prices and the loss of investment inflows during the COVID-19 pandemic.
