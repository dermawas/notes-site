**FlowformLab** is a personal journal on how things work — and how to make them work better (or at least, better *for me*).

It’s my working log — part notes, part diagrams, part reflection — a space to trace ideas as they flow, form, and evolve.

I write about what I learn while building, fixing, and understanding systems: digital, mechanical, and human.

It’s not about perfection — it’s about curiosity, iteration, and making sense of what we build.

Sometimes it’s technical, sometimes reflective, always hands-on.
