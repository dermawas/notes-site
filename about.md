## About

**FlowformLab** is a personal journal on how things work — and how to make them work better (or at least, better *for me*).

### Why the name?

The name reflects the heart of the practice:

**Flow** — exploring systems, habits, tools, and ways of working that create clarity and momentum.  
**Form** — shaping structure, models, and methods that bring order to ideas.  
**Lab** — a place to experiment, learn, break things, refine them, and try again.

Together: **a space where ideas flow, take form, and evolve through experimentation.**

---

It’s my working log — part notes, part diagrams, part reflection — a space to trace ideas as they flow, form, and evolve.

I write about what I learn while building, fixing, and understanding systems: digital, mechanical, and human.

It’s not about perfection — it’s about curiosity, iteration, and making sense of what we build.

Sometimes it’s technical, sometimes reflective, always hands-on.

## Working With AI

FlowformLab also experiments with **AI as a thinking partner and drafting tool** — not to replace the human voice, but to extend it.

Like any instrument in a lab, AI here is used with intention:

- to explore ideas faster  
- to prototype writing structures  
- to turn scattered thoughts into first drafts  
- to reflect back patterns and clarity  

The **Ghostwriter workflow** — built with n8n and a local LLM — is part of this exploration.  
It doesn’t “write for me.” It **helps me think**, then I shape, edit, and refine.

This is not automation for efficiency’s sake.  
It is a study in **augmented creativity, mindful tooling, and human-first writing**.

Sometimes the machine surprises me.  
Sometimes it gets in the way.

That’s the point — it’s an experiment.  
A lab is where tools are tested, assumptions are challenged, and craft evolves.
